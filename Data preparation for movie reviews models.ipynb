      "which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . \n",
      "they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \n",
      "so what are the problems with the movie ? \n",
      "well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . \n",
      "it starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . \n",
      "there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \n",
      "now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . \n",
      "it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \n",
      "and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \n",
      "not really . \n",
      "the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \n",
      "i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \n",

      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",
      "the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \n",
      "but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . \n",
      "overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \n",

      "other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \n",
      "stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \n",
      "interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \n",

      "the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \n",

      "i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \n",
      "squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . \n",
      "miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . \n",
      "so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \n",
      "the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \n",
      "in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . \n",
      "patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \n",
      "and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \n",
      "species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \n",
      "however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \n",
      "mr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \n",
      "like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \n",
      "last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \n",
      "this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \n",

      "informs eve ) . \n",
      "if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \n",

      "dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans . \n",
      "the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer . \n",
      "opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed . \n",
      "somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky . \n",
      "and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany . \n",
      "the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half . \n",
      "the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic . \n",

      "if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \n",
      "alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \n",
      "what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \n",
      "that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \n",
      "when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \n",
      "so why such a seemingly high rating ? \n",
      "there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \n",
      "first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \n",
      "the sound and screen kicked ass . \n",
      "nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \n",
      "also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . \n",
      "i even liked the computer-generated settings . \n",
      "i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \n",
      "also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \n",
      "william hurt isn't too bad either . \n",
      "neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \n",
      "and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \n",
      "there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \n",
      "it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \n",
      "those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \n",
      "that type of moviemaking is a lost art . \n",
      "now for the bad news . \n",
      "worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \n",
      "it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n",
      " \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \n",
      "and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \n",
      "second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \n",
      "the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \n",
      "once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \n",
      "when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' \" \n",
      "then there's the tone of the movie . \n",
      "the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \n",
      "then it could be an adventure movie . \n",
      "they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . \n",
      "still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \n",
      "just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who's the center of a family . \n",
      "many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \n",
      "and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \n",
      "in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \n",
      "we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \n",
      "in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \n",
      "that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \n",
      "finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \n",
      "the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \n",
      "why ? \n",
      "why bother saying what year this is . \n",
      "just tell us it's the future . \n",
      "i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \n",
      "setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \n",
      "then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \n",
      "this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . \n",
      "one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \n",
      "the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \n",
      "this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \n",
      "but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . \n",
      "still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \n",

      "if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \n",
      "so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \n",
      "my , how easily does the worm turn . \n",
      "hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \n",
      "at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \n",
      "and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \n",
      "boring . \n",
      "although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . \n",
      "_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \n",
      "these characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \n",
      "in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \n",
      "with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . \n",
      "as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \n",
      "what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \n",
      "even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \n",
      "dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . \n",
      "from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . \n",
      "but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \n",
      "aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \n",
      "shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \n",
      "this tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \n",
      "they fail on both counts . \n",
      "ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \n",
      "as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . \n",
      "too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \n",
      "anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \n",
      "when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \n",
      "strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \n",
      "there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \n",
      "they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \n",
      "these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . \n",

      "yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . \n",
      "practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . \n",
      "and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . \n",
      " ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . \n",

      " ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . \n",
      "murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . \n",
      "but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether . \n",
      "you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . \n",
      "for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . \n",

      "sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . \n",

      "murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . \n",
      " ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . \n",
      "you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . \n",

      "the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \n",
      "based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \n",

      "trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . \n",
      "if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here . \n",
      "early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . \n",
      "outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . \n",
      "they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . \n",
      "fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . \n",
      "the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . \n",
      "this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . \n",
      "even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . \n",
      "so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . \n",
      "the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an \" erotic thriller \" . \n",

      "i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something \" erotic , \" that he'd be happy after watching this fluff . \n",

      "i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . \n",

      "writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \n",

      "it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \n",
      " . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \n",
      "while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) . \n",
      "a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \n",

      "but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . \n",
      "van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \n",
      "early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \n",
      "even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \n",

      "this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \n",
      "for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \n",

      "it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \n",
      "the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \n",
      "tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \n",
      "there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . \n",

      "for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . \n",

      "mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \n",
      "porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \n",
      "the tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \n",
      "i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \n",
      "no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \n",
      "just because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn't . \n",
      "quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \n",
      "since none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \n",
      "lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \n",
      "meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \n",
      "unger , who made an impression in 1997's \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \n",
      "finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \n",
      "like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \n",
      "in the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \n",
      "and guess what ? \n",
      "not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \n",
      "even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \n",
      " \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \n",
      "perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \n",

      "kate and ricky don't get along and don't have any great ideas until they meet g ( eddie murphy ) , a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything . \n",
      "his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good , and it's this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network's success . \n",
      "the first problem is a flaw in the plot . \n",
      "sure , g makes people feel good . \n",
      "sure , we're told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item , no matter how wealthy they might be , and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought . \n",
      "but , hey , that's after they've bought it . \n",
      "why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera ? \n",
      "far from trying to sell the product , g instead blathers on about how you don't even need the thing . \n",
      "someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place . \n",
      "you might say that people feel good about what they've bought , so they come back and by more , but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable , i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind . \n",
      "the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible . \n",
      "another problem is in the humor . \n",
      "you know , if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie , i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy . \n",

      "murphy , the one asset you'd think this movie has ( remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense ? \n",
      "- then again , maybe you don't ) is seriously reigned in . \n",
      "the script gives him almost nothing to work with , and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn't be left as window dressing . \n",
      "there's only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose , and it lasts for three shouted words , which seem totally out of place as a result . \n",
      "pathetic . \n",
      "in all , there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture , and they're not even that great . \n",
      "as a side note , there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine , and james brown introducing a medic-alert device that shouts \" help me ! \" \n",
      "just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button , but these never cause your personal laugh-o-meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement . \n",

      "they look a lot like they're bored . \n",
      "just like the audience . \n",
      "so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy , and the acting is like the siberian steppes ? \n",
      "a film that drags more than a dropped anchor . \n",
      "but wait ! \n",
      "as if these problems don't make the film slow enough , the screenplay's pacing makes the movie even slower ! \n",
      "it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie's premise , then more time as the film wades through a tortuous ( and seemingly mandatory ) romance between ricky and kate , and a sub-plot involving a conniving pr man ( eric mccormack ) who wants to discredit g and take over ricky's job as producer . \n",
      "when the pr guy's plan is foiled , the film is climaxes , we're treated to that little epilogue , and then we can all go home , right ? \n",

      "in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \n",
      "of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \n",
      "the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \n",
      "the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \n",
      "flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \n",
      "we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \n",
      "it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \n",
      "symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that . \n",
      "we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \n",
      "harry survived , but his wife did not . \n",
      "a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \n",
      "there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \n",
      "although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \n",
      "they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak . \n",
      "they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \n",
      "however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \n",

      "when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . \" \n",
      "even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \n",
      "he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \n",

      "our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \n",
      "mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \n",

      "i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs . \n",
      "although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \n",
      "there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \n",
      "when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \n",
      "were they even attracted to each other ? \" \n",
      "if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \n",

      "james bond ? \n",
      "the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \n",
      "there are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything . \n",

      "it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \n",
      "if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \n",
      "in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough . \n",

      "it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \n",

      "the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \n",
      "sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \n",
      "the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \n",
      "i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \n",
      "there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \n",
      "because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \n",
      "one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \n",
      "i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \n",
      "the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \n",
      "first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \n",
      "he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \n",
      "the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \n",
      "it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \n",
      "another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \n",
      "i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \n",
      " ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \n",
      "is jackson's character then simply insane ? \n",
      "that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \n",
      "one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \n",

      "the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \n",

      "the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \n",
      "when \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \n",

      " \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \n",
      "but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \n",

      "brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i've ever heard . \n",
      "he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \n",
      "sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \n",
      "both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \n",
      "i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let's do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \n",
      "i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \n",
      "an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler . \n",
      "i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \n",
      "a far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction . \n",
      "a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \n",
      "the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \n",
      "woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \n",
      "hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting . \n",
      "i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \n",
      "the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \n",
      "every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \n",
      "instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \n",
      "the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \n",
      "would've been over in a half hour . \n",
      "the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \n",

      "but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . \n",
      "this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . \n",
      "get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie . \n",
      "travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . \n",

      "woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . \n",
      "with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . \n",
      "here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . \n",
      "there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . \n",
      "director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . \n",
      "the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . \n",
      "it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . \n",
      "a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . \n",
      "from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . \n",
      "still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits . \n",
      "the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . \n",
      "the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) . \n",
      "madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently . \n",
      "one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable . \n",
      ">from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . \n",
      "the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . \n",
      "in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films . \n",
      "the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . \n",
